#### DATA SOURCE:

> [Reed D. 2019. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012. Environmental Data Initiative.](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a593a675d644fdefb736750b291579a0) Data accessed 11/17/2019.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Introduction**

You're about to dive into some deep data collected from five reef sites in Santa Barbara County, all about the abundance of California spiny lobsters! 🦞 Data was gathered by divers annually from 2012 to 2018 across Naples, Mohawk, Isla Vista, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado reefs.

Why lobsters? Well, this sample provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) established on January 1, 2012 (Reed, 2019). Of these five reefs, Naples, and Isla Vista are MPAs, while the other three are not protected (non-MPAs). Comparing lobster health between these protected and non-protected areas gives us the chance to study how commercial and recreational fishing might impact these ecosystems.

We will consider the MPA sites the `treatment` group and use regression methods to explore whether protecting these reefs really makes a difference compared to non-MPA sites (our control group). In this assignment, we’ll think deeply about which causal inference assumptions hold up under the research design and identify where they fall short. 

Let’s break it down step by step and see what the data reveals! 📊

![](figures/map-5reefs.png)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 1: Anticipating potential sources of selection bias

**a.** Do the control sites (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, and Mohawk) provide a strong counterfactual for our treatment sites (Naples, Isla Vista)? Write a paragraph making a case for why this comparison is ceteris paribus or whether selection bias is likely (be specific!).  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 2: Read & wrangle data

**a.** Read in the raw data from the "data" folder named `spiny_abundance_sb_18.csv`. Name the data.frame `rawdata`

**b.** Use the function `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package

```{r}
# HINT: check for coding of missing values (`na = "-99999"`)

# Read in data, define -99999 as na
rawdata <- read_csv(here("data/spiny_abundance_sb_18.csv"), na = "-99999") %>% 
    clean_names() # Make columns names lower_case
    

```

**c.** Create a new `df` named `tidyata`. Using the variable `site` (reef location) create a new variable `reef` as a `factor` and add the following labels in the order listed (i.e., re-order the `levels`): 
    
    "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples"

```{r}

tidydata <- rawdata %>% 
    mutate(reef = factor(site, # Create new column called reef. Make it a factor based on site
                         levels =c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK", "IVEE", "NAPL"), #List values of site in order of new factor
                         # Create labels for new column in the same order as above
                         labels = c("Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples")))

    
```

Create new `df` named `spiny_counts` 

**d.** Create a new variable `counts` to allow for an analysis of lobster counts where the unit-level of observation is the total number of observed lobsters per `site`, `year` and `transect`. 

- Create a variable `mean_size` from the variable `size_mm`
- NOTE: The variable `counts` should have values which are integers (whole numbers). 
- Make sure to account for missing cases (`na`)!

**e.** Create a new variable `mpa` with levels `MPA` and `non_MPA`. For our regression analysis create a numerical variable `treat` where MPA sites are coded `1` and non_MPA sites are coded `0`

```{r}
#HINT(d): Use `group_by()` & `summarize()` to provide the total number of lobsters observed at each site-year-transect row-observation. 

#HINT(e): Use `case_when()` to create the 3 new variable columns

spiny_counts <- tidydata %>% 
    group_by(site, year, transect) %>% # Group data by site, year and transect
    summarize(
        counts = n(), # Create new column for counts of lobsters from new groups
        mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
                         .groups = "drop") %>% # Create a new column for mean size, ungroup
    mutate(
    mpa = case_when( # Create mpa column
      site %in% c("NAPL", "IVEE") ~ "MPA", # label 'MPA' when site is NAPL or IVEE
      site %in% c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK") ~ "non_MPA"# Label 'non_MPA' when site is AQUE, CARP, or MOHK
    ),
    mpa = factor(mpa, levels = c("non_MPA", "MPA")), # Set non_MPA as reference
    treat = case_when(
      site %in% c("NAPL", "IVEE") ~ 1,
      site %in% c("AQUE", "CARP", "MOHK") ~ 0
    )
  )
    


```

> NOTE: This step is crucial to the analysis. Check with a friend or come to TA/instructor office hours to make sure the counts are coded correctly!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 3: Explore & visualize data

**a.** Take a look at the data! Get familiar with the data in each `df` format (`tidydata`, `spiny_counts`)

**b.** We will focus on the variables `count`, `year`, `site`, and `treat`(`mpa`) to model lobster abundance. Create the following 4 plots using a different method each time from the 6 options provided. Add a layer (`geom`) to each of the plots including informative descriptive statistics (you choose; e.g., mean, median, SD, quartiles, range). Make sure each plot dimension is clearly labeled (e.g., axes, groups).

- [Density plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/density-plot-group-ggplot2)
- [Ridge plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/ggridges/)
- [Jitter plot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html) 
- [Violin plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/violin-plot-group-ggplot2) 
- [Histogram](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-density-ggplot2/) 
- [Beeswarm](https://r-charts.com/distribution/beeswarm/)

Create plots displaying the distribution of lobster **counts**:

1) grouped by reef site  
2) grouped by MPA status
3) grouped by year

Create a plot of lobster **size** :

4) You choose the grouping variable(s)!

```{r}
# plot 1: ....
# Count distribution by site - histogram
plot1 <- spiny_counts %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = counts)) + # display counts
    geom_histogram() +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(counts), linetype = "Mean"), color = "red", size = 1) +
    labs(title = "Distribution of Lobster Counts by Site",
         x = "Lobster Counts",
         y = "Frequency") +
    scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = c("Mean" = "dashed")) + # Add mean line
    facet_wrap(~site) # One plot for each site

# Count distribution by MPA status - density plot
plot2 <- spiny_counts %>% 
  group_by(mpa) %>%
  mutate(med = median(counts)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = counts, fill = mpa)) + # grouped by MPA status
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = med, color = mpa, linetype = "Median"), size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Density Distribution of Lobster Counts by MPA Status",
       x = "Lobster Counts",
       y = "Density") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#F26666", "#66F2F2")) + # custom colors
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#FF2626", "#1FA5C4")) +
  scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = c("Median" = "dashed"))

# Count distribution by year - jitter plot
plot3 <- spiny_counts %>% 
    #  We want to color by year since jitter plots can have some confusing overlap. In order to do this year must be a factor
  ggplot(aes(x = counts, y = year, color = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_jitter(size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(counts), linetype = "Mean"), size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Lobster Counts Across Years",
       x = "Lobster Counts",
       y = "Year") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(guide = "none") +  # Different color for each year
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = unique(spiny_counts$year)) +  # Label every year
  scale_linetype_manual(name = "", values = c("Mean" = "dashed")) # Key for stat

# Size distribution by MPA status - Violin plot
plot4 <- spiny_counts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mpa, y = mean_size, fill = mpa)) + 
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.6) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, aes(shape = "Mean"), geom = "point", size = 3, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Mean Lobster Size by MPA Status",
       x = "MPA Status",
       y = "Mean Size (mm)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#F26666", "#66F2F2"), guide = "none") +
  scale_shape_manual(name = "", values = c("Mean" = 16))
    
```

**c.** Compare means of the outcome by treatment group. Using the `tbl_summary()` function from the package [`gt_summary`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html) 

```{r}
# USE: gt_summary::tbl_summary()

spiny_counts %>%
  select(mpa, counts, mean_size, year) %>%  # Select variables to summarize
  tbl_summary(by = mpa)  # Group by mpa status
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 4: OLS regression- building intuition

**a.** Start with a simple OLS estimator of lobster counts regressed on treatment. Use the function `summ()` from the [`jtools`](https://jtools.jacob-long.com/) package to print the OLS output

**b.** Interpret the intercept & predictor coefficients *in your own words*. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the regression results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

The intercept coefficient value indicates the number of lobsters that we can expect at a non-MPA site. Specifically, our model indicates that we should expect to count an average of about 15 lobsters per year at a non-MPA site. The intercept indicates the change in the number of lobsters that we expect to see when we apply our treatment, or in this case, when we search for lobsters in an MPA. In this case, we expect an MPA site to have five more lobsters than a non-MPA site.

```{r}
# NOTE: We will not evaluate/interpret model fit in this assignment (e.g., R-square)

m1_ols <- lm(counts ~ mpa, data = spiny_counts)

summ(m1_ols, model.fit = FALSE) 

```


**d.** Explain the results of the 4 diagnostic plots. Why are we getting this result?

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols,  check = "qq" )
```
This first plot shows that our count distribution deviates from a normal distribution. This indicates that our counts are least consistent between sites near the lowest and highest bounds of our counts. We're getting this result because our distribution is not necessarily normal - and some sites may have many more large or small lobsters than other sites.


```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "normality")
```
The second plot shows the density of our residuals compared to that of a normal distribution. Our results have the highest density in the low-residual range, but generally follow the normal curve. This means we have low error. We're probably seeing this because most of our plots have a similar number of lobsters (5-15).


```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "homogeneity")
```
The third plot indicates that our errors are not consistent across our dataset. We're seeing this likely because there is a lot of variation in counts in the middle of our count range (25-50).

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "pp_check")
```
This plot indicates how well our model imitates the patterns found in our actual data. These results show that our model is not able to replicate the peak of our counts that are around 5-15. This is probably because we have so much data in this range, a simple lm can't account for the dispersion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 5: Fitting GLMs

**a.** Estimate a Poisson regression model using the `glm()` function

**b.** Interpret the predictor coefficient in your own words. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

**c.** Explain the statistical concept of dispersion and overdispersion in the context of this model. 

**d.** Compare results with previous model, explain change in the significance of the treatment effect

```{r}
#HINT1: Incidence Ratio Rate (IRR): Exponentiation of beta returns coefficient which is interpreted as the 'percent change' for a one unit increase in the predictor 

#HINT2: For the second glm() argument `family` use the following specification option `family = poisson(link = "log")`

m2_pois <- 

```

**e.** Check the model assumptions. Explain results.

**f.** Conduct tests for over-dispersion & zero-inflation. Explain results.

```{r}
check_model(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
check_overdispersion(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m2_pois)
```

**g.** Fit a negative binomial model using the function glm.nb() from the package `MASS` and check model diagnostics 

**h.** In 1-2 sentences explain rationale for fitting this GLM model.

**i.** Interpret the treatment estimate result in your own words. Compare with results from the previous model.

```{r}
library(MASS) ## NOTE: The `select()` function is masked. Use: `dplyr::select()` ##
```

```{r}

# NOTE: The `glm.nb()` function does not require a `family` argument

m3_nb <- 

```


```{r}
check_overdispersion(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_predictions(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_model(m3_nb)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 6: Compare models 

**a.** Use the `export_summ()` function from the `jtools` package to look at the three regression models you fit side-by-side.

**c.** Write a short paragraph comparing the results. Is the treatment effect `robust` or stable across the model specifications. 

```{r}

export_summs(# ADD MODELS
             model.names = c("OLS","Poisson", "NB"),
             statistics = "none")

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 7: Building intuition - fixed effects

**a.** Create  new `df` with the `year` variable converted to a factor

**b.** Run the following negative binomial model using `glm.nb()`

- Add fixed effects for `year` (i.e., dummy coefficients)
- Include an interaction term between variables `treat` & `year` (`treat*year`)

**c.** Take a look at the regression output. Each coefficient provides a comparison or the difference in means for a specific sub-group in the data. Informally, describe the what the model has estimated at a conceptual level (NOTE: you do not have to interpret coefficients individually)

**d.** Explain why the main effect for treatment is negative? *Does this result make sense?

```{r}

ff_counts <- spiny_counts %>% 
    mutate(year=as_factor(year))
    
m5_fixedeffs <- glm.nb(
    counts ~ 
        treat +
        year +
        treat*year,
    data = ff_counts)

summ(m5_fixedeffs, model.fit = FALSE)
```

**e.** Look at the model predictions: Use the `interact_plot()` function from package `interactions` to plot mean predictions by year and treatment status. 

**f.** Re-evaluate your responses (c) and (b) above. 

```{r}

interact_plot(m5_fixedeffs, pred = year, modx = treat,
              outcome.scale = "link") # NOTE: y-axis on log-scale

# HINT: Change `outcome.scale` to "response" to convert y-axis scale to counts
```

**g.** Using `ggplot()` create a plot in same style as the previous `interaction plot`, but displaying the original scale of the outcome variable (lobster counts). This type of plot is commonly used to show how the treatment effect changes across discrete time points (i.e., panel data).

The plot should have... 
- `year` on the x-axis
- `counts` on the y-axis
- `mpa` as the grouping variable


```{r}
# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

plot_counts <- 

# plot_counts %>% ggplot() ...
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Step 8: Reconsider causal identification assumptions

a. Discuss whether you think `spillover effects` are likely in this research context (see Glossary of terms; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIudsVcYhWGpqC-Uftk9UTz3PIq6stVyEpT44EPNgpE/edit?usp=sharing)
b. Explain why spillover is an issue for the identification of causal effects
c. How does spillover relate to impact in this research setting?
d. Discuss the following causal inference assumptions in the context of the MPA treatment effect estimator. Evaluate if each of the assumption are reasonable: 
    
    1) SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value assumption 
    2) Excludability assumption

------------------------------------------------------------------------
